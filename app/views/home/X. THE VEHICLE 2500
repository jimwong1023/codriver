X. THE VEHICLE 2500

A. VEHICLE REQUIREMENTS TO OPERATE ON THE ROAD
LIGHTS/INSTRUMENT PANEL INDICATORS
BELTS/FLUID LEVELS
HORN
Use Your Horn
Only when necessary, to avoid collisions.
To try to get "eye contact" with other drivers. You may tap your horn to alert another driver who might turn in front of you and cause a collision.
On narrow mountain roads, where you cannot see at least 200 feet ahead of your vehicle.
Don't Use Your Horn
If a driver or bicyclist is going slowly, and you want him or her to drive faster or get out of your way. The driver or bicyclist may not be able to safely go faster, due to illness, being lost, intoxication, or having mechanical problems with the vehicle.
To alert other drivers that they made a mistake. Your honking may cause them to make more mistakes or to become angry and retaliate.
Because you may be angry or upset.
To honk at pedestrians, bicyclists, or motorcyclists unless necessary to avoid a collision. Remember that your horn sounds much louder outside a vehicle.
NOTE: Honking your horn may startle other drivers. It is safer to slow down or stop instead of honking your horn.
WINDOWS/MIRRORS
TIRES (INCLUDING SPARES)
SEATS/CAR SEATS/CHILD SAFETY LOCKS (IN THE SIDE OF BACK DOORS)
SEAT BELTS
Seat belts, both the lap belt and shoulder harness, must be in good working order. You may not operate your vehicle on public roads and on private property, such as public parking lots, unless you and all of your passengers eight years of age or older, or children who are 4 feet 9 inches tall or taller are wearing seat belts; and children younger than eight years old or who are less than 4 feet 9 inches tall are seated in a federally-approved child passenger restraint system. You and all passengers must wear a seat belt or, you and/or your passenger(s) may be cited. If the passenger is under 16 years of age, you may be cited if he or she is not wearing his or her seat belt.
Always use your seat belts (including the shoulder harness) even if the vehicle is equipped with air bags. You can have shoulder harnesses or seat belts installed in older vehicles. Even if you wear only a lap belt when driving, your chances of living through a collision are twice as high as someone who does not wear a lap belt. If you wear a lap and shoulder belt, your chances are three to four times higher to live through a collision.
Pregnant women should wear the lap belt as low as possible under the abdomen, and the shoulder strap should be placed between the breasts and to the side of the abdomen’s bulge.
WARNING: Using seat belts reduces the risk of being thrown from your vehicle in a collision. If you do not install and use a shoulder harness with the seat (lap) belt, serious or fatal injuries may happen in some collisions. Lap-only belts increase the chance of spinal column and abdominal injuries—especially in children. Shoulder harnesses may be available for your vehicle, if it is not already equipped with them.
BRAKES

B. USE OF THE PARKING BRAKE
Along with the steering wheel and gas pedal, your brakes are the key controlling equipment on your vehicle.  The problem is, it's obvious when the steering wheel won't turn, or the accelerator doesn't make your car go, but it's not so obvious when your brakes are not working as well as they should. In the United States, the standard width between railroad tracks is four feet, eight and a half inches.  A gradual decrease in fluid pressure or the slow wearing of pads and rotors happen so gradually, your foot gets used to the change and compensates without your being aware of a problem.
Your parking brake and service brake must be operated separately; in case one system fails, you should be able to use the other.  Your parking brakes need to be able to hold your vehicle on any grade, under any load.  If you live in Mt. Lemmon, you probably know the condition of your brakes, parking and otherwise!  If, however, you live in Friendly Corners, you might not be aware of any braking problems that might appear under stressful conditions.  You should schedule regular checks of your brakes, by a professional; yearly inspections may not be adequate in all cases.

If your brakes are not performing at their best, you may not be able to stop your vehicle within the required stopping distance.
Stopping is only half the function of your vehicle's brakes.  Holding your car in a parked position is the other.  Your service brakes need to be able to keep your car in place temporarily; for example, if you are stopped on an up-hill grade, waiting for a red light to change, you want to be confident that your brakes will keep you from rolling backwards into the car behind you.  Your parking brake plays a more critical role, because it is used when you aren't there to monitor it. When you park your car, lock it, and walk away, you want to know that it is staying where you put it!  When the Three Stooges chase a car that's rolling backwards into the lake, that's funny.  Nobody's laughing though, when a real mom with real children slips down a boat ramp and drowns, because the parking brake gave out.  Do yourself and your loved ones a favor: have your parking brake checked by a professional.  And if you find yourself having to pull up on the brake lever, to the very last click, get it checked immediately.
When you have to park on a grade, use your tires as a back-up to your brakes. The position you leave your tires in can save your car, or a life, in case of brake failure. You can turn your wheels in such a way that your car will be stopped by a curb, or your car will roll away from traffic if there is no curb. 

Uphill, with a curb. Turn your front wheels toward the street, let your car roll back until the front wheels are against the curb, then set the parking brake.
Downhill, with a curb. Turn your front wheels toward the curb, let them come to rest on the curb, then set the parking brake.
Up- or downhill, with no curb. Turn the front wheels toward the side of the road; this will make your car roll away from the center of the road in case of brake failure.
Sloping driveways. Turn your wheels so that your vehicle won't roll into the street in case the brakes fail.
